        card_body: "Concurrency is the act of having your computer do multiple things at the same time. If you’ve heard lots of talk about asyncio being added to Python but are curious how it compares to other concurrency methods or are wondering what concurrency is and how it might speed up your program, you’ve come to the right place.",
